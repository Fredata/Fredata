- 👋 Hi, I’m Fereidoun Rouhi (@Fredata) 
- 👀 I am passionate about working with data and understanding the logic and data mechanism, and customer
orientations via gathering data from various websites. For the past five years, I have studied and analyzed
the findings of Google Analytics for a variety of websites. Considering my ten years experience in B2B
and B2C sales and marketing both online and offline I would be an experienced data analyst.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analyst Programs. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects.
